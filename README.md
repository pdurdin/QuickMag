# Installing QuickMag
To install, navigate to your QGIS Python plugin folder and create a new folder "quick_mag". Download all files into that folder.

In QGIS, you can check that the plugin is installed and enabled via the Plugin Manager. The QuickMag icon will appear on the Plugins Toolbar.

# Using QuickMag
Click the toolbar button to open the QuickMag dialog.
Browse to and select your ASC data file.
Click Run. The points layer will be generated first, followed by the raster. The latter will be displayed as a greyscale plot at +/- 3 nT.

Processing may take some time, depending on the size of your data file. The dialog will show the total processing time once it is finished.
